## 🔍 About Me

I’m a Data Science student with hands-on experience in data analysis and business intelligence through an internship and multiple end-to-end projects.

I completed a data analytics internship at ElevanceSkills, where I worked on a Job Market Analysis Dashboard, analyzing 1.35M+ job postings across 1,000+ cities and 90K+ companies using SQL and Tableau to uncover global hiring trends.

Alongside this, I have built Python-based data analysis projects, including a Job Listings Scraper & Analysis, where I collected real-world job data and performed exploratory analysis to identify hiring patterns.

I enjoy working with large datasets, building KPI-driven dashboards, and transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights.
