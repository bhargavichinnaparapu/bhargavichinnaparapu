## About Me

I am a B.Sc. Data Science student with hands-on experience in Data Analysis and Business Intelligence, gained through a structured internship and real-world projects.

I have worked with SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to analyze large datasets and convert data into meaningful, actionable insights. During my Data Analyst internship at ElevanceSkills, I analyzed 1.35M+ job postings across 1,000+ cities and 90K+ companies, built KPI-driven dashboards, and identified key hiring trends.

My project experience includes building interactive Power BI dashboards using DAX, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, and developing data pipelines for job market analysis using web scraping and visualization techniques.

I enjoy solving business problems through data, creating insightful dashboards, and continuously learning new tools and techniques. I am currently seeking entry-level Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making.
