## About Me
I am a B.Sc. Data Science student with practical experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and reporting through internships and academic projects. I have worked with large, real-world datasets using SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to analyze trends, build dashboards, and support data-driven decision-making.

My experience includes SQL-based data analysis, KPI development, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization for business use cases such as job market analysis and sales performance evaluation. I am comfortable working with structured data, designing star-schema data models, and creating interactive dashboards using DAX and Tableau.

I am seeking an entry-level Data Analyst or Business Analyst role where I can apply analytical skills, problem-solving ability, and attention to detail to deliver meaningful insights and business value.
