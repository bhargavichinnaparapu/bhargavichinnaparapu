## About Me

I’m a Data Science student with hands-on experience in data analysis and business intelligence through an internship and multiple end-to-end projects.

I completed a data analytics internship at **ElevanceSkills**, where I worked on a **Job Market Analysis Dashboard**, analyzing **1.35M+ job postings across 1,000+ cities and 90K+ companies** using SQL and Tableau to uncover global hiring trends.

Alongside this, I have built Python- and BI-based data analysis projects, including dashboards and web-scraping workflows, to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights.

I enjoy working with large datasets, building KPI-driven dashboards, and delivering insights that support data-driven decision-making.
